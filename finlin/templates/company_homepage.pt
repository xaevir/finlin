                <h2>Revenue Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    Avantair generates revenues primarily through the sale of fractional ownership shares of aircraft, by providing management 
                    and maintenance services related to these aircraft, and from the sale of flight hour cards providing either 15 or 25 hours 
                    of flight time per year of access to its aircraft fleet (either individually or through the Company’s Axis Club Membership program). 
                    The Company markets and sells fractional ownership interests to individuals and businesses with a minimum share size of a one-sixteenth 
                    ownership interest. Under management and maintenance agreements with fractional owners, Avantair provides pilots, maintenance, fuel and 
                    hangar space for the aircraft. 
                </p>
                <h2>Pricing Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    Avantair believes that the pricing structure afforded by utilizing the Piaggio Avanti allows Avantair to attract a customer 
                    desiring quality at a lower price point. Offering the cabin cross section of a mid-size aircraft and fuel efficiency of a 
                    turboprop, along with no hourly fees, allows Avantair to lower the cost of private air travel for a broader range of consumers. 
                </p>
                <h2>Growth Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    Avantair’s primary growth strategy is to continue to increase the number of fractional share owners and aircraft under management 
                    as well as increase the number of flight hour cards and Axis Club Memberships sold. At June 30, 2010, the Company had 28.5 fractional 
                    aircraft shares available for sale. In addition to the cost of acquiring aircraft, Avantair’s primary expenses are related to fuel, 
                    aircraft repositioning (i.e., moving an aircraft to another location to accommodate a customer’s need and for demonstration flights 
                    for sales purposes), maintenance, charters and insurance. To finance its growth strategy, the Company will continue to actively pursue 
                    additional funds through some or a combination of equity financing, including the sale of additional shares of common and preferred stock, 
                    asset sales, accelerated payments of management and maintenance fees or debt financing.
                </p>
                <h2>Product Strategy</h2>
                <p>
                    Avantair’s management believes its card program to be a means of introducing potential purchasers to its fractional ownership program. 
                    Avantair’s card program currently is priced at $105,000 for a 25 hour card. Additionally, Avantair created an introductory 25 hour 
                    card for a first flight hour card purchaser currently at a rate of $95,000. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 2006, Avantair introduced the Edge Card Program, which allows a purchaser to access Avantair’s aircraft for 15 or 25 hours of flight time without the requirement to purchase ownership shares in an aircraft. The card holder purchases the entire card amount in advance and receives the same service as a fractional owner. After the card holder has exhausted the hours purchased, the holder has no further obligations to Avantair. The program offers an alternative to fractional ownership for individuals and businesses seeking to experience private aircraft travel. 
                </p>

                <h2>Pure Competition on Operation Efficiency</h2>
                <p>
                    Avantair’s management believes that fractional and flight hour card aircraft operators compete on the basis of aircraft model and 
                    features, price, customer service and scheduling flexibility. Avantair’s management believes that customers are generally willing to 
                    continue to use the same aircraft operator so long as such operator provides satisfactory service with competitive pricing. Avantair’s 
                    management believes that the quality of its aircraft and service, and the value it provides to its customers, enables it to compete 
                    effectively against its larger competitors. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Interstingly they are the low cost provider. Now there add shows a cost decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Avantair’s growth strategy involves increasing the number of available aircraft, fractional share owners, flight hour card 
                    and membership program participants and fixed base operations. Achieving Avantair’s growth strategy is critical in order for 
                    its business to achieve economies of scale and to achieve profitability. Any condition that would deny, limit or delay its 
                    ability to acquire additional aircraft, sell fractional shares, flight hour cards and/or memberships and open additional 
                    fixed base operations in the future will constrain Avantair’s ability to grow. Acquiring additional aircraft, selling 
                    fractional shares, flight hour cards and/or memberships and opening fixed base operations requires Avantair to commit a 
                    substantial amount of resources. Expansion is also dependent upon Avantair’s ability to maintain a safe and secure operation 
                    and will require additional personnel, equipment and facilities.

                            favorably to light jets as the Piaggio Avanti has the lowest fuel usage in the category. This aircraft also allows access to a 
                            greater number of airports than most of the jets in its category since it has the capability to land on shorter runways.
